# project-euler
my project euler solutions 

to revisit: 
- prob_2: compare runtimes of memory optimized fibonacci's/recursive fibonaccis/while loops. also worth it to rewrite in ocaml and see the time difference. functional programming is made for this 
- prob_3: rewrite prime sieves, time 
- prob 7: actually implement prime sieve
- prob 8: time/memory analysis of using strings vs. using integers
- prob 9: brute force script could be cool complement
