# project-euler
my project euler solutions 

to revisit: 
- prob_2: compare runtimes of memory optimized fibonacci's/recursive fibonaccis/while loops. also worth it to rewrite in ocaml and see the time difference. functional programming is made for this 
- prob_3: rewrite prime sieves, time 
- prob 4: there is an *abhorrent* (beautiful?) solution incorportating primes into the answer. this is beyond my range of ability.
